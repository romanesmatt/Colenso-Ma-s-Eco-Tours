        <h2>How We Strive For Sustainability</h2>
        <p>Colenso-Ma's Eco-Tours aims to be a carbon neutral tour company by 2024. We have made strides to ensure we meet this goal for the long term well-being of our planet. </p>
        
        <p>
        Our fleet vehicles are all electric. Thanks to Nissan New Zealand, our fleet of Nissan EV's transport our customers and employees safe and sound while producing no harmful gases. We have also partnered with Flamingo Scooters and Onzo Bikes to provide electric scooters and bicycles respectively. You also have the option to walk on foot if you would like that extra bit of exercise during your tour!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Our main offices also operate in an enviromentally sustainable manner. We have policies onboard which restrict us to using energy efficient appliances, that we conserve energy and water where possible and most importantly to challenge ourselves to preserve the beautiful world we have.
        </p>
